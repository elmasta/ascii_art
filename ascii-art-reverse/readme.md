how to create your own ascii art to test:

go to ascii-art-reverse/"output source code"/main
type "go build"
put the executable at ascii-art-reverse/main (at the same level as the reverse main.go)
launch it with, for example ./main --output=fileName.txt "lolilol"
the file will be stored in the examples folder
